# Hello, World!
This repository contains a "Hello, World!" sample demonstrating how to use the ASMotor motor68k assembler in a Calypsi 68K project.

It is based on the Calypsi sample of the same name, but builds debug and release in different target directories. The root directory is kept clean except for the final target binary (eg hello.pgz)
